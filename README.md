HearthBnB is a passion project inspired by one of my favorite childhood games, **World of Warcraft**. Since the *Legion* era, I’ve found peace exploring Azeroth, visiting its many inns, and sampling regional delicacies. While many are familiar with the iconic **Lions Pride Inn** or the bustling taverns of **Dalaran**, fewer may know of the **floating inn at Speedbarge Bar** or the serene beauty of the **Golden Rose in Pandaria**.  

To celebrate *Azeroth’s 30th anniversary*, I built **HearthBnB** as a tribute to the countless hours spent adventuring through this world.  

### 🛠 **Tech Stack:**

Step into the world of Azeroth and book a stay at its most legendary inns.  
**For the Horde! For the Alliance! For Azeroth!** 🍻
